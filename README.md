# docker-twonkyserver
[TwonkyMedia server (TMS)](http://twonky.com/) is DLNA-compliant UPnP AV server software from PacketVideo. It runs on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows Home Server, and Windows 7 computers as well as Android, iOS, and other mobile platforms. TwonkyMedia server can be used to share and stream media to most UPnP AV or DLNA-compliant clients, in addition to non-UPnP devices through the HTML, RSS, and JSON supported front ends.
In this docker image beside the TwonkyMedia server also ffmpeg is included to allow thumbnail creation and stream transcoding. The includes ffmpeg is based on the the static builds from [johnvansickle](https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/).
The docker image is based on phusion.

You will need a valid licence to run the TwonkyMedia server inside this docker container

## Usage

```
docker run -d --net=host --name=twonkyserver -v /path/to/config:/config:rw -v /path/to/data:/data:ro -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro fff/twonkyserver
```

After starting the docker container go to:

http://server:9000/webconfig

## Parameters
* `-v /config` - Where TwonkyMedia server stores its config files
* `-v /data` - Where TwonkyMedia server will find the media to share via DLNA
* `-v /etc/localtime` - Set to use the corect time setting with TwonkyMedia server 
* `-e PGID` for GroupID - see below for explanation
* `-e PUID` for UserID - see below for explanation
* `--net=host` Used to DLNA communication in the network

### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. To avoid this issue you are allowed to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" â„¢.

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`. To find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id <dockeruser>
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```
